When I was a child I liked to <span className='text-secondary font-bold'>create things</span>, from drawings to craftsmanship, at home we still use a crochet carpet I did many years ago. I was also <span className='text-secondary font-bold'>eager to understand how things worked</span>, I remember that I disassembled a lantern I couldn't assemble it back ðŸ˜…

I didn't know the <span className='text-accent font-bold'>wonderful world of programming</span> up until my <span className='text-primary'>graduation</span>, I started doing Mechanical Engineering at a Polytechnique School where I had some computer science classes and <span className='text-secondary font-bold'>feel in love with it</span>.

In my professional journey I've been blessed with <span className='text-secondary font-bold'>amazing co-workers</span> who <span className='text-secondary font-bold'>taught me</span> how to <span className='text-primary font-bold'>improve as a developer</span> and <span className='text-primary font-bold'>become a better person</span>.

A memorable event was in a <span className='text-accent'>one on one feedback with my senior</span>, I was <span className='text-secondary'>praising him</span> for being <span className='text-secondary font-bold'>patient</span> and <span className='text-secondary font-bold'>explaining</span> everything with <span className='text-secondary font-bold'>so much care and detail</span>, then he told me <span className='text-accent font-bold'>one of the most important life lessons</span>:
