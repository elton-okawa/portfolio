As a convention when we are learning a new programming language, our first task is to create a "Hello World" program, so here we are with my first blog post!

The idea here is to apply an interesting concept of [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) I've read recently, the idea is to build a <span className='text-secondary text-bold'>persistent knowledge base</span> that grows overtime for the <span className="text-primary text-bold">future me</span> and perhaps help other people who stumble across the same problems I had.
