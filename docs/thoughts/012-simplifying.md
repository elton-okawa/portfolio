# Jul 26, 2025 - Simplifying

## Revisiting

After almost 2 years I came back to update this page and man... what over engineering I was doing. I just need a simple page to highlight my achievements and talk a bit more personal projects or write articles about it, but what I found is a monorepo with GraphQL and SSR using GraphQL that was experimental at that time.

Readme helped a lot to get started again and each thought written reminded me what I was thinking at that time. I know I learnt a lot during the journey of setup it but I realized that "less is more", that's why I decided to focus on having a better presentation and a simpler setup.
